this page try to show you algorithms that is very important to solve some problems in economics and statistics

## Budget Allocation Optimization Based on Regional Input-Output Tables https://github.com/AZFARHAD24511/Input-output-applications

In response to the increasing demand from provincial management and planning organizations for optimal budget allocation across various economic sectors—with the constraint that a minimum economic growth rate (e.g., 6%) must be achieved while covering a broad spectrum of sectors—I have developed a program specifically designed for this purpose.

This program operates based on regional input-output tables and provides two main outputs:

- **Determination of the minimum budget required to achieve the targeted economic growth;**

- **Identification of which economic sectors will experience nominal growth in value added under this allocation and by how much.**

In this program, the nominal growth rate of value added and the desired inflation rate are input by the user. Then, using the accounting logic of the input-output table, the program extracts and calculates the necessary parameters. This tool assists planners in making budget decisions scientifically and data-driven.

## Nowcasting https://github.com/AZFARHAD24511/nowcasting
Numerous forecasting methodologies have been proposed in economic literature, with models such as VAR, ARMA, and ARIMA standing out for time series analysis. However, accessing the requisite data for these models—especially at high frequencies like daily—poses significant challenges. Even when such data is available, it is often not published in a timely manner. Consequently, decision-makers and economic policymakers lack awareness of daily and weekly fluctuations in the country's economy.

This project aims to investigate whether Google Trends data, which is published at various frequencies (monthly, daily, and even hourly), has predictive power for foreign trade—a critical target variable. To this end, daily Google Trends data from 2006 to October 2023 was extracted via the Google Trends API. Concurrently, foreign trade data was obtained from the German Federal Government Statistics Office website.
